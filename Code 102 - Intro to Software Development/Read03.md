# summary :
1. HTML pages are text documents.
2. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
   brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
3. Tags are often referred to as elements.
4.  Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
    the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
5. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
   about the content of that element.
6. Attributes require a name and a value.
7. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
   available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go

# when building web page you must keep these point in your mind :
 
 * How to understand the audience your site may attract and
     what information they will expect to find on it. 
 * How to organize information so that visitors can find what
     they are looking for.
 * Design theory for presenting information in a way that
     elps visitors achieve their goals.   
 * Design tips to help you create more attractive and
     professional sites 

 # How to understand the audience :
* What is the age range of your target audience
* Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix
* Which country do your visitors live in
* Do they live in urban or rural areas
* What is the average income of visitors
* What level of education do they have
* What is their marital or family status
* What is their occupation
* How many hours do they work per week
* How often do they use the web
* What kind of device do they use to access the web 

# understand Why People Visit YOUR Website :
 * **Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your
   website, most will visit for a specific reason.**

# What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve : 
  * **First you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site. You can then assign the list of tasks to the   fictional visitors you created in the step described on the previous page** 
 1. **It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you
   are looking for key tasks and motivations** 
 2. **This information can help guide your site designs.**

# What Information Your Visitors Need :
* You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to   achieve their goals quickly and effectively.
You may want to offer additional
supporting information that you
think they might find helpful.

* **Look at each of the reasons why              
people will be visiting your site
and determine what they need to
achieve their goals.**

* **You can prioritize levels of
information from key points
down to non-essential or
background information.**

* **By ensuring that you provide the
information that your visitors
are looking for, they will consider
your site more relevant to them.**

* **Therefore, you will have more
opportunity to tell them any
extra information that you think
would be helpful to them 
(or to expose them to other products and services you want to promote).**

* **If you do not appear relevant to
them by answering their needs,
however, they are likely to go
elsewhere.**

* **Here are some questions to help
you decide what information to
provide for visitors to your site...**

# **site map** 
* Now that you know what needs to appear
   on your site, you can start to organize the 
    information into sections or pages.
    ## the way you need to organice your page using what called site map :

# **WireFrames**  
 * **A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
     information that needs to go on each page of a
     site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
     and how much space it might require.**

# 
* **t's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.**
* **Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.**
* **Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
   will need to go on each page.**
* **Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
    visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.**
* **You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.**
* **You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.**
