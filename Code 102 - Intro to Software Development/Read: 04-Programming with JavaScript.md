# **about script**
1. A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
2. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
3. Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
4. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).



* Programming is about giving the computer a series of instructions in a format it understands. Programs are everywhere, running Mars rovers, the Large Hadron Collider, engine management systems, financial markets, drones, phones, tablets, TVs, and medical equipment. The power and versatility of programs are astonishing. Programs can be a few lines long or millions of lines long, with complex solutions built from simple building blocks.

* JavaScript is an incredibly popular programming language, mostly seen in web browsers but gaining popularity in other contexts. On web pages it adds interactivity, from simple animation effects to form validation to full-blown single-page applications. Servers—programs that make files, web pages, and other resources available on the internet—are now written using JavaScript with Node.js. Other programs can be scripted with JavaScript, like Photoshop and Minecraft, and some databases store JavaScript and let you query data with JavaScript. And as more and more network-enabled objects are added to the Internet of Things, JavaScript is becoming more popular for programming sensors, robots, drones, and Arduino-style electronics.

* Learning to program gives you a great skill that’s versatile, useful, stimulating, creative, fun, rewarding, and in demand. Learning to program with JavaScript puts one of the world’s most widely used languages at your fingertips, letting you develop applications for all manner of uses, devices, platforms, and OSes.
