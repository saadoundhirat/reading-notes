 ## growth-mind-set
 **In my mind the growth mind set is one of the basic topix in this field be because its ahuge field and if you dont have that way of thinking you will get lost i will show why in simple way :**

 1. *this field will take most of your time and sitting in front of your laptop search and fixing bugus that will face you so you have to be patient and have the will to keep going*

 2. *to success in this fiels iam sure you will get destroied at the bigging you need to but all your effort and take any problem the will face you as achallenge to enjoy what you are doing*

 # __here is my reminders__

 1. ### View challenges as opportunities
 2. ### Replace the word “failing” with the word learning
 3. ### Think realistically about time and effort
