# **LIST**
## TYPES OF LIST :
1. Ordered lists :each item in the list is
numbered
2. Unordered lists :lists that begin with a bullet point.
3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

- OL-TAG : used to define that we want to use Ordered lists 
- UL-TAG : used to define that we want to use UnOrdered lists.
- li-TAG : Is used to add list items to the list .
-Definition Lists :build with dl-tag 
- dl TAG: dl element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
- dt TAG This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term)
- dd tag :This is used to contain the
definition.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

# **BOX:**
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.

 -You can set several properties that affect the  appearance of these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:
- Control the dimensions of your boxes: (WIDTH , HEIGHT, MIN-WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH , MIN-HEIGHT AND MAX-HEIGHT).
- Overflowing CONTENT : from this property we tells the browser what we want to do with the contant of abox 
  and written like this: 1- overflow : hidden; 2-overflow:scroll;
‚óè Create borders around boxes: 
   Border, Margin & Padding :
   1- border :Every box has a border (even if
      it is not visible or is specified to
      be 0 pixels wide). The border
      separates the edge of one box (border-width: 2px;) to see the hidden border.
      also there is style for borders such as(solid,dashed , dotted ...ect)
   2- The padding and margin propertie are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.  from another.
   -margin :Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
   (p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
})
   -padding : the space between the content and container. 
- Set margins and padding for boxes
- Show and hide boxes by controling box visibility.
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding
  for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and
   visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
   inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
   boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
   borders and rounded borders

   # **Decisions and Loops**
-  IF-STATMENT:Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions

* WE CAN ALSO USE IF-ELSE IF I HAVE MORE THAN POSSIBLE CONDTIONS.

- SWITCH STATEMENTS :

# **TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES**
- TRUTHY:values are treated as if they are true. Almost everything that is not in the falsy table can be treated as if it were true.
- FALSY:values are treated as if they are fa 1 se. The table to the left shows a hi ghScore variable with
a series of values, all of which are falsy.

# **LOOPING IN JAVA-SCRIPT**
* Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
1. FOR LOOP :loops through a block of code a number of times

2.while: loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

3.DO-WHILE: also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

- Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.

- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.

- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.

-if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

- switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).

- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
