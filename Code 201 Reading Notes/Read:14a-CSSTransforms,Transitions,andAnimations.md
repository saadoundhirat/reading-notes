# Read: 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations :

## Transforms:

- we can use transform in css to manibulate the look or effict on on some element the transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

- transform :- property specifies how nested elements are rendered in 3D space.

- transform-origin :- allows you to change the position of transformed elements.

# Transitions & Animations:

-With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

- Transitional Property
The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an elementâ€™s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

## Animations
- Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.
