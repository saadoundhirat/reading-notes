# **IMAGES :**

- Controling your images size is so important its keeps rules that
  affect the presentation of your page in
  the CSS and out of the HTML markup

# how can we use images in our design :

1. Specify the size and alignment of an image using.
2. Add background images to boxes.
3. Create image rollovers in CSS.

- we control the image size by using (width ,hight ) proparties .

### why its important to spicify the width and hight :

- when you render your page the HTML AND CSS will render before the images so by spicifing the image size we tell the browser how mush space to leave for our images.
- its better to use the same size for all your images in your web site.

- centering image :
  `img.align-center { display: block; margin: 0px auto;} img.medium { width: 250px; height: 250px;}`
