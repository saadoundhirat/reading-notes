# About Graphs

- A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

- Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
Directed vs Undirected
Undirected Graphs
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

## Connected

- A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

- ConnectedGraph
In the visual above, this looks a lot more than what you are used to seeing. If you look closely at the different vertices of the graph, you will see that each node is connected to at least one other node or vertices. A Tree is a form of a connected graph. We will talk more about that in a bit.

## Disconnected

A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

# Breadth First

In a breadth first traversal, you are starting at a specific vertex/node. This node must be specified when calling the BreadthFirst() method. The breadth-first traversal of a graph is like that of a tree, with the exception that graphs can have cycles. When a graph has cycles and we are trying to traverse, this leaves the possibility to be in an infinite loop….this is bad. To prevent such behavior, we need to have some sort of flag that specifies if we have already visited that vertices. Upon each visit, we just set the “visited” flag from false to true.

## Depth First

In a depth first traversal, we approach it a bit different than the way we do when working with a depth first traversal of a tree. Similar to how the breadth-first uses a queue, we are going to use a Stack for our depth-first traversal.

## The algorithm for a depth first traversal is as follows

- Push the root node into the stack
- Start a while loop while the stack is not empty
- Peek at the top node in the stack
- If the top node has unvisited children, mark the top node as visited, and then Push any unvisited children back into the stack.
- If the top node does not have any unvisited children, Pop that node off the stack
- repeat until the stack is empty.
- Let’s look at the visual for a depth-first traversal.

- Graphs are extremely popular when it comes to it’s uses. Here are just a few examples of graphs in use:

- GPS and Mapping
- Driving Directions
- Social Networks
- Airline Traffic
- Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
