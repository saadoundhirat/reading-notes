# Open-Source Software Contribution:

    -Contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. Perhaps you’re a Code Newbie or maybe you’ve been coding for a while but haven’t found a project you felt comfortable contributing to.

## What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

    - Improve Coding Skills:
        - In order to help young programmers improve their skills, a number of OSS projects now include tickets designed for aspiring programmers to gain genuine programming experience, such as Symfony’s selection of
        easy picks.
        - Apart from providing novice programmers with experience, they also free up the core developers’ schedule so they can spend that time tackling more difficult issues or improving the software in other ways.
    
    - Gain Early Experience:
        - The OSS projects also provide a platform for developers to gain early experience with the software, which can help them gain a better understanding of the software’s inner-workings.
    
    - Increase Community and Peer Recognition:
        - The OSS projects also provide a platform for developers to gain recognition for their work.
    
    - Increase Software Reputation:
        - The OSS projects also provide a platform for developers to gain reputation for their work.
    
    - Greater Job Prospects:
        - The fact that OSS is visible to the public means that prospective employers can inspect your code and assess your skills as a developer based on the code you have written. In contrast, commercial (proprietary) software doesn’t provide you with the same proof of your abilities, and overall it is much harder to gain experience in this realm.
