# About Big O notation:

---
- Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. ... In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

- We use big-Θ notation to asymptotically bound the growth of a running time to within constant factors above and below.

- Big-O-notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

- Can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.

- represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

- O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set.

- big-Θ notation bounds the running time from both above and below, rather than just from above.

## Facts and myths about Python names and values

- This talk is about some fundamental concepts in Python: names and values
- Python is a very approachable language. Often it works just as you expect if you come to it from other languages. But you might suddenly encounter surprising behavior.
- The underlying mechanisms of Python are often quite simple, but their combined effects might not be what you expect. By understanding the mechanisms, you can reason about their effects.
- The local names in the function are drawn in a new frame. Calling the function assigned the actual values to the parameter names, just like any other assignment statement
