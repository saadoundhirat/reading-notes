 _ **summary:**

- Whenever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
form element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms

 # **events:** 

- HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

- **eventshandling:**

JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

 * there are three way to handel events :
 
 1- HTML EVENT HANDLERS.
 2- TRADITIONAL DOM EVENT HANDLERS
 3- DOM LEVEL 2 EVENT LISTENERS

# event_flow:
1- documents
2- html
3- body tag
4- ul tag
5- li tag
6- a tag


# **summary**:

- Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).

- Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.

- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.

- You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.

- The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.
