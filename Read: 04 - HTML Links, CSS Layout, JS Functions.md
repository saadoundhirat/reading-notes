# **HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions**

- so this is the basic structure for linking tag and it is called anchor tag, and by using it you can refer for other websites in your page, so in the example above we can see that we refer to the google website in the href=’’ part and what appears on the user screen is what you type inside the tag.

another way of using the tag is to link a specific with a word of your choice to send an email when it is clicked mail us one of the best features in html when writing a link is the ability to open a link in new tab for example a href=’www.google.com target=\_blank tap here to get into google in new tab

The final feature of the links in HTML is that you can link a specific part of the page with another in the by giving the same page by using the id for example: paragraph 1

content of the paragraph

so when you click on the paragraph 1 it will take you to the paragraph with the same id of “test” in the same page.

positioning in CSS there is several positioning ways in CSS: 1-the first one is the default one which is static positioning where each block-level element sits on the top of the next one position: static; 2-the second one is relative positioning which is simply where you want to move the block-level element from its default position from the 4 sides: position: relative; left: 100px; top: 50px; so it will move to the right for 100px and to the bottom for 50px 3-the third type of positioning is absolute positioning and what you can benifit from this kind of positioning is that the element that is given a absolute positioning it will act and position where ever you like and will deal with other elements aas if they are not visible position: absluote; 4-the fourth type of positions is fixed which is type of the absolute position but the fixed element will stay on the screen even if the user scrolls up and down and the most common use for it is the heading of the web page position: fixed; 5- the fifth one is z- index which is used for overlaping elements.

the truthy and falsy values: -fasly? falsy values for the variables: boolean false 0 empty string undefined not a number (NaN) truthy values for the variables: true 1 “carrot” 10/5 “0” “false” .

### Function Invocation:

The code inside the function will execute when “something” invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)
Function Return
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will “return” to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is “returned” back to the “caller”:

Why Functions?
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

Functions Used as Variable Values
Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

### Pair Programming

Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments.

### Reasons for Pair Programming:

At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills. but Why pair program?

While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
