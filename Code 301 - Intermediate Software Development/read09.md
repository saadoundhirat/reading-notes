# Readings: FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## **What is functional programming?**

* **Answer:** Functional programming is a programming paradigm, meaning that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles (listed above). Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural programming.

## **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

* **Answer:** function will be avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions

Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and
Has no side-effects

## **What are the benefits of a pure function?**

* **Answer:** Functional code tends to be more concise, more predictable, and easier to test than imperative or object oriented code — but if you’re unfamiliar with it and the common patterns associated with it, functional code can also seem a lot more dense, and the related literature can be impenetrable to newcomers.

## **What is immutability?**

* **Answer:** object is an object that can’t be modified after it’s created.

## **What is Referential transparency?**

* **Answer:** referential transparency is generally defined as the fact that an expression, in a program, may be replaced by its value (or anything having the same value) without changing the result of the program.

## **Node JS Tutorial for Beginners**

## **What is a module?**

* **Answer:**
JS modules (also known as “ES modules” or “ECMAScript modules”) are a major new feature, or rather a collection of new features. You may have used a userland JavaScript module system in the past. ... All of these module systems have one thing in common: they allow you to import and export stuff

## **What does the word ‘require’ do??**

* **Answer:**
to claim or ask for by right and authority

## **How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

* **Answer:**
Import the module named mymodule

## **What do we have to do to make a module available?**

* **Answer:**
 The module is a variable that represents the current module, and exports is an object that will be exposed as a module. So, whatever you assign to module. exports will be exposed as a module.
