## Readings: Mongo and Mongoose

# **What is auth**

----------

## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases

#### SQL

1. use tables to store data
2. SQL databases have predefined schema
3. SQL databases are vertically scalable
4. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware
5. SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data
6. SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL

#### NoSQL

1. use documents
2. NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data
3. the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
4. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load
5. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
6. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

-------------------

## **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

* **Answer:** If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined

## **Give a real world example?**

* **Answer:** (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

## **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

* **Answer:** NoSQL seems to work better on both unstructured and unrelated data. The better solutions are the crossover databases that have elements of both NoSQL and SQL.

## **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

* **Answer:** Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.

## **Which type of database is best for scalability??**

* **Answer:**  MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, all are highly scalable, it's just that they require little maintenance for it. All SQL based databases are very stable, and are in production since years.


-------------------

## **What does SQL stand for?**

* **Answer:**  ( structured query language )

## **What is a realational database?**

* **Answer:** A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

## **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

* **Answer:**  relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures.

## **What is a ‘schema’?**

* **Answer:**  A schema is a mental concept that informs a person about what to expect from a variety of experiences and situations. Schemas are developed based on information provided by life experiences and are then stored in memory.

## **What is a NoSQL database?**

* **Answer:** NoSQL, which stands for “not only SQL,” is an approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases

## **Howo does it work?**

* **Answer:**  schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases

## **What is inside of a Mongo database?**

* **Answer:** Documents

## **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why?**

* **Answer:**mongoDB dont have to use schema

## **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

* **Answer:** 
1. MongoDB uses high memory for data storage.
2. There is a limit for document size, i.e. 16mb.
3. There is no transaction support in MongoDB.
