  something about the information that lies
  between their opening and closing tags.

  about the contents of an element. They appear
  on the opening tag of the element and are
  made up of two parts: a name and a value,
  separated by an equals sign.

# **THE ABC OF PROGRAMING:**

In order too start writing code in java script you must understand what is script Ascript is set of instruction or order given to your web page to do script run line by line
and while script you will find that it contains alot of precise instructions such as specifing a value to be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
and there is something called variable where you store your values to do what ever you want with them and there is type of variabels called arrayes which allowe you to store more than on value inside them

> Expressions evaluate into a single value.
> Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
