# **html**
* html has multiple levels of heading from h1 to h6 and allow you to make it font bigger and bollder.

- headings is not about the font change its used to show the importace of the heading so h1 is most important and h6 is least.

# paragraph :
- To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p>tag and closing </p> tag

* Bold & italic :

By enclosing words in the tags and we can make characters appear bold.

* Superscript & Subscript:
The element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.
The element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.

# **CSS**
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

- Rules are made up of selectors and declarations

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

- Declarations are made up of two parts:
the properties of the element that you want to change
and the values of those properties.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.


 ## *EXPRESSIONS*
- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value.

* there are two types of expressions:
- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
  var color = ‘beige’;
- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
- var area = 3 * 2;
- OPERATORS
- operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

- same examples in expression and for more
(X = 3 > 5)
(Y =(5 >3) && (2 < 4>))
